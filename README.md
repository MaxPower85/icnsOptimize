# icnsOptimize
A bash script to manage optimizing and creating .icns files

To run this script, make sure that you have installed createicns (https://github.com/avl7771/createicns), pngquant (https://github.com/kornelski/pngquant) and zopflipng (https://github.com/google/zopfli) and that you can use them without having to type the full path (you can place them in /usr/local/bin for that).

To use the script, click "Clone or Download" and after downloading icnsOptimize-master.zip and decompressing it, open your Terminal, then drag & drop the icnsOptimize.sh inside and press Return (Enter).
